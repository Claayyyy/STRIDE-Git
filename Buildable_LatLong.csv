Region V,Legaspi City,114458,Bogna Elementary School,LEGAZPI CITY  (Capital),2nd ,1,3STY6CL,,4,0,0,1,0,0,6,YES,YES,NO,"The planned construction of a new building with a footprint of approximately 360 square meters within the declared 2,500 square meter site of Bogna Elementary School requires a formal relocation survey. Although the property is officially recorded under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 16059 in the name of the DECS Division of Legazpi City and Tax Declaration No. 0530580 under the City of Legazpi, preliminary measurements using Google Earth suggest that the actual area occupied by the school may extend up to 7,500 square meters.

To make room for the new structure, the demolition of existing facilities may be necessary—particularly Building No. 8, a Bagong Lipunan School Building (BLSB) Type I, which is currently classified as needing major repair. While the current fence alignment and available open space suggest that the new building can be accommodated, a relocation survey is essential to confirm whether the documented property boundaries accurately reflect the true extent of the school site. This survey will also help determine any possible encroachments or overlaps with adjacent Lot No. 4142, registered under Ms. Paula Nuñez and covered by Tax Declaration No. 03-0053-00455.

In addition, several trees within the proposed construction area will be affected and must be removed to clear the site. All tree-cutting activities must comply with environmental regulations and should include appropriate mitigation measures, such as replanting or implementing greening initiatives.

It is also important to note that the proposed location for the new three-storey, six-classroom building (3STY6CL) lies at the lowest elevation of the school lot. Therefore, site improvements are necessary to ensure proper drainage and minimize the risk of flooding. If feasible, the installation of an additional drainage system is recommended to manage surface runoff and protect the structural integrity of the new facility. Moreover, the finished floor level of the ground floor must be elevated to prevent floodwaters from disrupting school operations and compromising the safety of students and staff.

Lastly, while the site development plan prepared by the DepEd Central Office is drawn to scale, it does not show the actual location of the titled lots in relation to the existing fence boundaries. As such, there is currently no assurance that the present fence alignment corresponds to the legal property limits. This further underscores the need for an actual survey and evaluation by DepEd Geodetic Engineers, as well as a review of legal documents by the DepEd Technical Assistant II currently deployed in the Province of Albay and Legazpi City, to validate the property’s legal and spatial configuration prior to construction.","Yes, drawn to scale",None,1,"However, The proposed construction of a new building with a footprint of approximately 500 square meters within the declared 2,500 square meter school site of Bogna Elementary School requires a formal relocation survey. Although the site is officially documented under TCT No. 16059 and Tax Declaration No. 0530580, preliminary measurements using Google Earth suggest that the actual area occupied by the school is approximately 7,500 square meters. / Subject For relocation Survey

The relocation survey is essential to verify the true boundaries of Lot No. 4253-A and determine whether the proposed building falls within the legally defined property limits. If the survey confirms that the building footprint overlaps with areas occupied by old existing classrooms, these structures may be replaced as part of the development. However, if the footprint falls within areas where buildings have been newly constructed or repaired within the last five years, the project cannot be implemented due to restrictions on modifying recently improved facilities.

Additionally, the current fence alignment indicates that the proposed structure can be accommodated within the site, but only a verified relocation survey can ensure compliance with property boundaries and avoid encroachment on adjacent Lot No. 4142 under Ms. Paula Nuñez (Tax Declaration No. 03-0053-00455).",With title (TCT/OCT/Special Patent),"Lot No. 4253-A, with a declared area of 2,500 square meters, is covered by TCT No. 16059 under the name of the DECS Division of Legazpi City and Tax Declaration No. 0530580 under the City of Legazpi. However, based on measurements taken via Google Earth, the actual school site appears to cover approximately 7,500 square meters. With the demolition of old existing school buildings and the current fence alignment suggesting that the new structures can be accommodated, a formal relocation survey is necessary to verify whether the lots fall within the actual property boundaries. This survey will also determine whether the documented 2,500 square meter area under the TCT accurately reflects the true extent of the school site, and clarify any potential overlaps with adjacent Lot No. 4142 under Ms. Paula Nuñez (Tax Declaration No. 03-0053-00455)",1,"however, To facilitate access to the proposed construction site at Bogna Elementary School, preparatory activities such as tree cutting and demolition of old structures must be undertaken—but only if the relocation survey confirms that the building footprint falls within the area currently occupied by old or dilapidated classrooms. In this case, the new building, with an estimated footprint of 500 square meters, may be accommodated within the declared 2,500 square meter school site under TCT No. 16059 and Tax Declaration No. 0530580.
 
 However, if the relocation survey reveals that the proposed building overlaps with areas containing newly constructed or recently repaired classrooms (within the last five years), the project is not viable and cannot proceed. Preliminary measurements using Google Earth suggest the actual school site may span approximately 7,500 square meters, further underscoring the need for a formal relocation survey to verify property boundaries and guide implementation decisions.",1,"Bogna Elementary School is operationally ready, with active enrollment and ongoing educational activities, and remains within the Department of Education’s priority areas for infrastructure investment.",1,"however, To ensure the implementability of the proposed infrastructure scope at Bigaa Integrated School, the proposed construction of a new building with a footprint of approximately 500 square meters within the declared 2,500 square meter school site of Bogna Elementary School requires a formal relocation survey.",0,"As of this date, there is no existing record of soil testing conducted at Bogna Elementary School. However, the school has been included in the Department of Public Works and Highways' (DPWH) funding request for soil investigation under the CY 2026 budget allocation",13.18812,123.7276
Region V,Legaspi City,114490,Gogon CS,LEGAZPI CITY  (Capital),2nd ,1,3STY9CL,,7,0,0,1,0,0,9,YES,YES,NO,"Gogon Central School (GCS) is initiating a comprehensive infrastructure development plan to enhance its educational facilities. The school head has proposed the construction of a science laboratory on the topmost floor of a new building to maximize space and provide a dedicated area for science instruction. To accommodate this, Building No. 2—a one-storey concrete structure funded by the Local Government Unit and completed in 1968—along with the existing stand-alone comfort rooms, will be demolished.

In their place, a new three-storey building with nine classrooms (3STY9CL) will be constructed on the same site. This vertical expansion aims to address classroom shortages and modernize the school’s learning environment. To ensure the smooth implementation of the project, the relocation of electrical lines and the cutting of trees within the area are necessary. All environmental activities will comply with regulatory standards and include appropriate mitigation measures.

Gogon Central School shares its property with Gogon High School (GHS), which was originally under the jurisdiction of GCS. When GHS was established, a portion of the lot was allocated for its use, reflecting a shared historical and ownership connection with the City Government of Legazpi.

The legal foundation of GCS’s presence is supported by a deed of donation dated July 18, 1989, in which the City of Legazpi—represented by then-Mayor Benjamin S. Imperial—donated the property to Secretary of Education Lourdes R. Quisumbing. This was further reinforced by a second deed of donation executed on July 20, 2009, with Mayor Noel E. Rosal representing the city and Schools Division Superintendent Epifanio Buela accepting the donation on behalf of the Department of Education.

The property is officially documented under Tax Declaration Nos. 0380901 and 0380896 for Cadastral Lots 943 and 944, and Tax Declaration No. 038981 for Cadastral Lot 942-B. However, the site currently faces challenges due to the presence of informal settlers, with six families residing on the east side and fifteen families on the west side of the lot. Addressing this issue will require coordinated legal and social action to support relocation efforts and align with the school’s long-term development goals.

As such, there is currently no assurance that the present fence alignment corresponds to the legal property limits. This further underscores the need for an actual survey and evaluation by DepEd Geodetic Engineers, as well as a review of legal documents by the DepEd Technical Assistant II currently deployed in the Province of Albay and Legazpi City, to validate the property’s legal and spatial configuration prior to construction.","Yes, but NOT drawn to scale",None,1,"But with demolition of old existing school buildings. Based on the existing fence alignment, the building can be accommodated; however, a relocation survey must first be conducted to verify whether the lots fall within the actual property boundaries. ",Deed of Donation,"Gogon Central School (GCS) and Gogon High School (GHS) share a common property. Initially, the site was under the jurisdiction of GCS; however, when GHS was established, a portion of the lot was allocated for its use. This shared arrangement reflects a significant historical and ownership connection with the City Government of Legazpi.

The foundation of Gogon Central School’s presence is anchored in a deed of donation dated July 18, 1989, in which the City of Legazpi—represented by then-Mayor Benjamin S. Imperial—donated the property to the Secretary of Education, Lourdes R. Quisumbing. This initial act formalized the school’s establishment within the city’s educational landscape.

Further strengthening its legal standing, a subsequent deed of donation was executed on July 20, 2009, with Mayor Noel E. Rosal representing the City of Legazpi and Schools Division Superintendent Epifanio Buela serving as the recipient on behalf of the Department of Education.

Additionally, the property is supported by official tax declarations: Tax Declaration Nos. 0380901 and 0380896 correspond to Cadastral Lots 943 and 944, while Tax Declaration No. 038981 pertains to Cadastral Lot 942-B.

At present, the site is occupied by informal settlers, with six families residing on the east side of the lot and fifteen families on the west side. This situation presents challenges to land utilization and infrastructure development, and may require coordinated action to address legal, social, and relocation concerns in alignment with the school’s long-term plans.",1,"To facilitate access to the construction site, activities such as tree cutting, demolition of old existing buildings and other stuctures must be undertaken.",1,"Gogon Central School is operationally ready, with active enrollment and ongoing educational activities.
